0.1-2

* Bad bug fix: I'd failed to track an internal lme4 change, so that 
  gamm4 had stopped extracting random effect variances correctly. 
  This meant that gamm4 standard errors were typically too low. 
  Fixed and checks added to test suite to detect this sort of problem.  

0.1-1

* Allow for centering of smooth model matrix columns, when there is an 
  intercept, but columns are not centered by constraint.

0.1-0

* Upgraded to use `t2' type tensor product smooths

* bug fix so that s(...,fx=TRUE) works

* workaround in gamm4 so that g/lmer handles offset properly.

0.0-4

* covariance matrix calculation was still not robust enough. Improved 
further.

0.0-3

* solving for the coefficient covariance matrix could fail under heavy 
  smoothing --- now made more robust. 

* `gamm4' can now be supplied with prior weights. 

* The `cbind(success,failure)' form for a binomial response now works 
  properly.

* help file has been updated for mgcv_1.6-2, and to avoid running to 
  many slow `gamm' calls in checking.

0.0-2

* gamm4 now returns a `scale.estimated' field in its `gam' object
  part.
