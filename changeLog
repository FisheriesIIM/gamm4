0.1-0

* Upgraded to use `t2' type tensor product smooths

* bug fix so that s(...,fx=TRUE) works

* workaround in gamm4 so that g/lmer handles offset properly.

0.0-4

* covariance matrix calculation was still not robust enough. Improved 
further.

0.0-3

* solving for the coefficient covariance matrix could fail under heavy 
  smoothing --- now made more robust. 

* `gamm4' can now be supplied with prior weights. 

* The `cbind(success,failure)' form for a binomial response now works 
  properly.

* help file has been updated for mgcv_1.6-2, and to avoid running to 
  many slow `gamm' calls in checking.

0.0-2

* gamm4 now returns a `scale.estimated' field in its `gam' object
  part.
